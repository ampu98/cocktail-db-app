## React Cocktails App

This project is a Cocktail Finder built using React that demonstrates key features of the React ecosystem, including React Router, Context API, and CSS for styling. The app allows users to search and explore different cocktail recipes with a user-friendly interface.

## Key Features

## React Router: Dynamic routing enables smooth navigation between pages such as the cocktail list, details, and error pages without reloading the entire app.

## Context API: Centralized state management using React's Context API to share data like cocktail details and search results across multiple components without prop drilling.

## SCSS/CSS Styling: Clean and responsive design using SCSS for modular and maintainable styles. The app is fully responsive, making it accessible on devices of all screen sizes.

Technologies Used
## React: For building the UI components.
## React Router: For handling navigation and routing between different views.
## Context API: For managing global state such as the cocktails data and search queries.
## SCSS/CSS: For styling the components and layouts with variables, mixins, and modularized CSS.
